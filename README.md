# Anagram Builder 

A silly little thing that lets you make anagrams out of words and phrases, and keeps track of your best few goes.

## Why, though?

This was an idea I had on the treadmill in the gym and decided to knock together one night while I was bored.

## How to play?

Type your word or phrase in the first input box and hit enter, then type an anagram of your phrase into the second box and hit enter.

As you type the page will track what letters you've used, and when you enter it'll validate that you're using real words.

The page tracks your 5 best attempts on the right.

## Still TODO

- The UX is pretty flakey,
  - Clearing the input when you use a letter you don't have is janky,
  - Having to reload the page to start over is bad.
- Might be useful to break this out into several files rather than having everything in one.
